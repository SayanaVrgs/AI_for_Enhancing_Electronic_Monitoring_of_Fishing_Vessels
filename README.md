# AI for Enhancing Electronic Monitoring of Fishing_Vessels

## Overview

One of the major tasks undertaken at the Department of Fisheries (DoF), Canada is catch monitoring. Catch monitoring provides in depth information about the fishing activities on any given fishing expedition. Despite its advantages, and its global use for monitoring, adoption of electronic monitoring system in major fishing regions is still slow. There are two major challenges for this systemâ€™s widespread adoption, namely: 
1. The large storage requirement for the video footage recorded, and
2. The long time required by analysts to review the video footage.
   
A single fishing trip can generate a huge amount of video data. Also, a large amount of time and additional resources would be required to analyse such huge sets of data. Currently, only certain portions of videos (chosen at random or identified due to some discrepancy) are audited for monitoring purpose. Hence, the data provided by the monitoring system is not being utilised efficiently. The need of the hour is an automated solution, using AI, to effectively utilise the data captured by EMs for efficient monitoring purpose.
